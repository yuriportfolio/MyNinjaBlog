    abstract = "{We present the Radio Galaxy Classifier (RGC), a set of tools for classifying radio galaxies, that includes two pre-processed dataset and a semi-supervised machine-learning model. The dataset are created using the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) taken by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The semi-supervised model is constructed using the state-of-the-art self-supervised method BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) where we have used a group-equivariant convolutional neural network as the feature extractor. We show the performance of the model for two different cases: a three-class classification of Fanaroff-Riley (FR) galaxies into FR 0, FR I and FR II, and a two-class classification of head-tail (HT) galaxies into wide-angled tail (WAT) and narrow-angled tail (NAT) galaxies.}",
